# Customer-segmentation

   Customer Segmentation is a popular application of unsupervised learning. Using clustering,
identify segments of customers to target the potential user base. They divide customers into
groups according to common characteristics like gender, age, interests, and spending habits so
they can market to each group effectively. Use K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering
and also visualize the gender and age distributions. Then analyze their annual incomes and 
spending scores.
